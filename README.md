WHY ARE SOME MULTIPLIERS RED AND SOME GREEN?
Based on the multipliers, we can expect half of all rolls to be 1.97x or lower and the other half to be 1.98x or higher.
Coloring these rolls either red or green depending on which half they are in allows players to quickly visualize how favorable rolls have been for players.
